# Introduction

This is a sample code using Web speech api. There is a server and client application. Once the speak ability is enabled this application is able to speak out the live train status! 

 - Web speech api
 - Server side events using Node js

In order to run this project very simple
- go to client folder and run ```npm i ```
- go to server folder and run  ```npm i ```

then

- go to server folder and run ```npm start```
- go to client folder and run ```npm start```

when you run npm start under client folder it is using react scripts which will open up the browser for you
open the devtool and see the logs in the dev tool. Feel free to fork this! 
Happy coding and if you have some idea then pm me thanks.
